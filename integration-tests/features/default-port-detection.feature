Feature: Get information about ports which will be forwarded from source

Scenario: Return default port detected on source machine - discovered ports only
   Given the local virtual machines:
         | name       | definition          | ensure_fresh |
         | source     | centos6-guest-httpd | no          |
         | target     | centos7-target      | no          |
     Then get list of discovered ports from source which will be forwared to target

Scenario: Return default port detected on source machine - override port 80
   Given the local virtual machines:
         | name       | definition          | ensure_fresh |
         | source     | centos6-guest-httpd | no           |
         | target     | centos7-target      | no           |
     Then get list of discovered ports on source which will be forwarded to target and override port 80 to 8080

Scenario: Return default port detected on source machine - add port 8080 and try to map it on 80 (collision)
   Given the local virtual machines:
         | name       | definition          | ensure_fresh |
         | source     | centos6-guest-httpd | no           |
         | target     | centos7-target      | no           |
     Then get list of discovered ports on source which will be forwarded to target and add port 8080 to 81 after collision detection

Scenario: Return default port detected on source machine - add port 11111
   Given the local virtual machines:
         | name       | definition          | ensure_fresh |
         | source     | centos6-guest-httpd | no           |
         | target     | centos7-target      | no           |
     Then get list of discovered ports on source which will be forwarded to target and add port 11111 to 11111

Scenario: Disable default port mapping and return user defined ports - port 11111, port 11112
   Given the local virtual machines:
         | name       | definition          | ensure_fresh |
         | source     | centos6-guest-httpd | no           |
         | target     | centos7-target      | no           |
     Then get list of user defined ports from source which will be forwarded to target - port 11111, port 11112

Scenario: Return default port detected on source machine - disable 111
   Given the local virtual machines:
         | name       | definition          | ensure_fresh |
         | source     | centos6-guest-httpd | no           |
         | target     | centos7-target      | no           |
     Then get list of discovered ports on source which will be forwarded to target and disable port 111

Scenario: Return default port detected on source machine - enable 1111 && disable 1111
   Given the local virtual machines:
         | name       | definition          | ensure_fresh |
         | source     | centos6-guest-httpd | no           |
         | target     | centos7-target      | no           |
     Then get list of discovered ports on source which will be forwarded to target and port 1111 will not be added

Scenario: Detect a collision in map defined by user
   Given the local virtual machines:
         | name       | definition          | ensure_fresh |
         | source     | centos6-guest-httpd | no           |
         | target     | centos7-target      | no           |
     When A manually mapped target port 144 is used multiple times for different source port
     Then An exception will be raised and tool will exit 

Scenario: Detect a collision created by mapping source port to unavailable port on target
   Given the local virtual machines:
         | name       | definition          | ensure_fresh |
         | source     | centos6-guest-httpd | no           |
         | target     | centos7-target      | no           |
     When A manually mapped source port 22 is already used on target port 22
     Then An exception will be raised and tool will exit
